    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    bands[2] = 'Stevie Ray Vaughan' //original array is updated
    console.log(music, bands);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const music2 = music.slice();  //make copy of original array(and create new object, changes in music2 don't affect music

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const music3 = [].concat(music);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const music4 = [...music];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'Peter Goroh',
        age: 34
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    const photographer = person;
    // photographer.number = 99; // changed added to person

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 55})
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
